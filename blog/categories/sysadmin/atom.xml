    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/jigish/slate" title="Slate: github repository">Slate</a>, an
open-source window-management tool for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>It is very cool, mainly in that it is very configurable (but with a
reasonably readable syntax for its configuration file).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Perhaps the most important thing to say is: Do not judge it solely
based upon its default configuration file, which is very bare bones
and does not illustrate anything near the full feature set that it
offers.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend one at least read over Tristan Hume'e <a href="http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/" title="Tristan Hume: Using Slate">blog post</a>,
which advertises Slate much more effectively than the project&rsquo;s
github page.  The blog post describes some of the crucial features that are not
exposed in the default configuration.  In particular, the
window-switcher shortcut, which overlays each window with a
letter to give that window focus, is much more tile-friendly
if you also turn on</p>

<pre><code>config windowHintsIgnoreHiddenWindows false
config windowHintsShowIcons true
</code></pre>

<p>You can see this and other custimzations I have made for myself
in my own <code>.slate</code> file, which I keep with my other dotfiles in
<a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix/DotFiles/blob/master/slate" title="Felix's DotFiles github repo">my public repository</a>.</p>
