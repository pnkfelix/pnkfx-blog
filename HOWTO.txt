* `rake new_post["Title goes here."]`: creates template for a new post
  in `source/_posts/`.

* `rake generate` converts post source into static html pages,
  rooted at `_deploy/index.html`.

  * One might need to use `LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 rake generate`
    or `LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 rake generate` to get around encoding issues.
    For some reason I think my older laptop does not need this but the newer
    one does.

  * https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/267 recommends setting this
    in one's `~/.profile`, which I suppose I will consider doing eventually
    if I encounter similar problems.

* `rake preview` starts a local webserver for previewing generated content;
  visit via http://localhost:4000/
  Note that this preview version at port 4000 includes unpublished posts
  (i.e. one's with `published: false`), while the pages in `_deploy/` will
  not include unpublished posts.

* `rake deploy` deploys the content to the target site (i.e.: takes it live).
