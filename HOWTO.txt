* `rake new_post["Title goes here."]`: creates template for a new post
  in `source/_posts/`.

* `rake generate` converts post source into static html pages,
  rooted at `_deploy/index.html`.

* `rake preview` starts a local webserver for previewing generated content;
  visit via http://localhost:4000/
  Note that this preview version at port 4000 includes unpublished posts
  (i.e. one's with `published: false`), while the pages in `_deploy/` will
  not include unpublished posts.

* `rake deploy` deploys the content to the target site (i.e.: takes it live).
