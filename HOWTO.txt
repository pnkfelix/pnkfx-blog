* `rake new_post["Title goes here."]`: creates template for a new post
  in `source/_posts/`.

* `bundle exec rake generate` converts post source into static html pages,
  rooted at `_deploy/index.html`.

  * (Originally I just had `rake generate` above, but then recently
    that yielded page generation errors, see discussion here:
    https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/585

    *SO* close to dropping octopress...)

  * One might need to use `LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 rake generate`
    or `LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 rake generate` to get around encoding issues.
    For some reason I think my older laptop does not need this but the newer
    one does.

  * In particular my use of the word "voil√†" caused me to hit this issue.

  * https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/267 recommends setting this
    in one's `~/.profile`, which I suppose I will consider doing eventually
    if I encounter similar problems.

* `jekyll serve --drafts` starts a local webserver for previewing generated
   content; visit via `http://localhost:4000/`

   Note that this preview version at port 4000 includes unpublished posts
   in the `source/_drafts/` folder, which will not be published on calls
   to `rake generate` or `rake deploy`.

   `rake preview` also starts a local webserver for previewing generated content,
   but it has different behavior in how it handles drafting (it wants you to
   embed `published: false` into draft files, at least originally, and I
   cannot get even that to work with Octopress 3.0), and it seems like it is
   generally less reliable than using `jekyll serve` directly (e.g. it seemed
   to take an absurdly long time to pick up on when I made changes to my draft
   posts).

* `rake deploy` deploys the content to the target site (i.e.: takes it live).

## Ruby maintenance

If it seems like ruby itself is broken, here are some steps I had to
do recently to fix ruby on my OS X machine.

```
# Not sure if this step was *actually* necessary

% git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

```
# I had to add the "without tk/tcl" options on OS X, otherwise it tries to #include X11 stuff
# during its build.

% CONFIGURE_OPTS="--without-tk --without-tcl" rbenv install 1.9.3-p194
```

```
# This installed bundler globally (I think)
% gem install bundler

# This grabbed the stuff needed for octopress (I ran it in the blog project directory).
% bundle install
```
