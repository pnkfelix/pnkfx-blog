    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/jigish/slate" title="Slate: github repository">Slate</a>, an
open-source window-management tool for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>It is very cool, mainly in that it is very configurable (but with a
reasonably readable syntax for its configuration file).</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing to say is: Do not judge it solely
based upon its default configuration file, which is very bare bones
and does not illustrate anything near the full feature set that it
offers.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend one at least read over Tristan Hume&#8217;e <a href="http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/" title="Tristan Hume: Using Slate">blog post</a>,
which advertises Slate much more effectively than the project&#8217;s
github page.  The blog post describes some of the crucial features that are not
exposed in the default configuration.  In particular, the
window-switcher shortcut, which overlays each window with a
letter to give that window focus, is much more tile-friendly
if you also turn on</p>

<pre><code>config windowHintsIgnoreHiddenWindows false
config windowHintsShowIcons true
</code></pre>

<p>You can see this and other custimzations I have made for myself
in my own <code>.slate</code> file, which I keep with my other dotfiles in
<a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix/DotFiles/blob/master/slate" title="Felix's DotFiles github repo">my public repository</a>.</p>

Apparently Markdown syntax does not have any shorthand for comments

First 7 lines of this file were generated by command invocation:
  % rake new_post["Hello World"]
-->


<p>First post!
I am attempting to move my blog to GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>After seeing the results of others, I figure I will start with Octopress
and see how that goes.</p>

<p>Just so I can remind myself of the Octopress basics in the immediate future:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Much of the page generation is controlled by configuration file <code>_config.yml</code></p></li>
<li><p>The content is all stored in <code>source/_posts/</code></p></li>
<li><p>This particular entry corresponds to the file <code>2012-12-31-hello-world.markdown</code></p></li>
<li><p>The first 7 lines of that file were originally generated via the
<code>rake</code> command invocation:</p>

<pre><code>% rake new_post["Hello World"]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The command <code>rake generate</code> will convert the source into static html pages.</p></li>
<li><p>After generating the file (and during subsequent editting), one can preview
the state locally in a local Ruby webserver via:</p>

<pre><code>% rake preview
</code></pre>

<p>and then <a href="http://localhost:4000/">browsing localhost port 4000</a>.
The <code>rake preview</code> invocation will continuously monitor your post
source files so that you can keep working on your post and then
reload in your web browser without rerunning <code>rake</code> itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The command <code>rake deploy</code> is supposed to deploy the content into its intended
live location.  I have been having difficulty using this command,
in part because I think it is written assuming you have your ssh-key
already set up and integrated with github (or something similar) so that
there would be no password prompts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>But of course I have not done this yet.</p></li>
<li><p>One important detail about <code>rake deploy</code> with github pages is that
the <code>_deploy/</code> subdirectory is itself a clone of the targetted
github repository, with the <code>gh-pages</code> branch checked out.
This can be confusing if your main source tree (the parent
directory of <code>_deploy/</code>) is itself the same repository as the
targetted github repository.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Update: <code>rake deploy</code> just worked fine for me, password prompts and all.
I think my earlier difficulty was an artifact of some previous bad
state, one of either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had put in a malformatted url for the target repository</p></li>
<li><p>My target repository already had a <code>gh-pages</code> branch (from earlier
testing) that needed to be pulled-and-merged (or discarded in some
fashion, which was what my merge amounted to).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
