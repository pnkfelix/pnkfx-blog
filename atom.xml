    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(This post is largely a response to Niko Matsakis&#8217;s blog post
<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/01/17/destructors-and-finalizers-in-rust/">Destructors and Finalizers in Rust</a>.  I started composing it as a comment there,
but eventually realized I needed more breathing room.)</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with Niko&#8217;s statement that the Boehm paper
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2002/HPL-2002-335.html">&#8220;Destructors, Finalizers, and Synchronization&#8221;</a> is a really nice
discussion of this topic.
However, a significant portion of the destructor/finalizer design space is
only briefly discussed in that paper, and I worry that Niko&#8217;s post overlooks
it.</p>

<p>There are designs that do not run finalizers directly from the garbage
collection process (whether that collector be a coroutine with the mutator, or
a concurrently running thread), and instead run finalization code
at explicit points in the code of the mutator (or mutator threads).</p>

<p>To me, such an approach seems appropriate for systems-level programming;
it seems to align with the spirit of giving the programmer access to the set of
knobs they need for explicit sequencing and resource management (or rope
to hang themselves with).</p>

<h2>Explicit Cleanup</h2>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/guardians-pldi93.pdf">guardian</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/finalization-137655.html">reference-queue</a> family of systems (see
also <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/willexecutor.html">wills and executors</a>), resource cleanup code is no longer asynchronously
run by the GC.  Instead, cleanup is the obligation of the
mutator.  The only asynchronous cleanup action of the garbage collector
is to add entries to the appropriate guardians/reference queues (that is, the
queues associated with an object that has been appropriately registered and
subsequently discovered to be unreachable).</p>

<p>I have included a more explicit description of what a Guardian API is like in
the appendix at the end of this blog post, in case the previous paragraph was
too terse.</p>

<p>With such an API in hand, developers can build <a href="http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/sw2010/02-hsu.pdf">libraries</a> that one can
plausibly reason about, in a single- or multi-threaded context.</p>

<p>To be fair: Boehm <em>does</em> address these approaches briefly; see the beginning
of section 3.5.1 of his paper, &#8220;Explicit Finalizer Invocation&#8221;.  However,
he also mixes them in with Java&#8217;s <code>System.runFinalization()</code> and the motivation
for that method.  Thus one must take care to distinguish which of Boehm&#8217;s complaints
apply to all explicit finalization systems, and which apply solely to systems
such as Java with <code>runFinalization</code> that provide a mix of explicit and implicit finalization.</p>

<h2>Passing the Buck</h2>

<p>One important characteristic (some might say &#8220;drawback&#8221;) of explicit
finalization approaches is that the mutator does need to periodically process
its associated guardians/reference queues.  After all, with the transfer of
responsibility for cleanup from the collector to the mutator, the mutator must
meet this obligation eventually.</p>

<p>One standard way to do this is to sprinkle cleanup code (i.e. &#8220;check if
guardian has entries; if so, process some of them&#8221;) at points in the control
flow of library routines using that guardian.  (In other words, in languages
with guardians, library designers can hopefully isolate the cleanup code behind the interface of the library that
requires such cleanup.)</p>

<p>In fact, since there are distinct guardians/reference-queues, one can
prioritize the scheduling (i.e. frequency and incremental-cost) of the
cleanups according to the characteristics of individual libraries, within the
mutator.  Contrast this against relying on the scheduling of the garbage collector with its
single finalization queue for the whole heap.</p>

<p>The two main problems with explicit cleanup from my point of view are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>ensuring that the necessary processing does <em>eventually</em> happen
(i.e. prevent resource leaks when control does not often (or ever) flow back into the
developer&#8217;s library utilizing the guardian), and</p></li>
<li><p>inserting finalizer invocations across the code of a library detracts
from its readability; they are a clear example of a cross-cutting concern that
should be factored into its own &#8220;aspect.&#8221;</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Boehm essentially covers both of the points above (though on first reading I
only interpreted him as describing the second point):</p>

<blockquote><p>This appears to be the safest way to handle finalization in single-threaded
code, although it has some clear disadvantages in certain contexts:
Potentially large amounts of code, especially long running routines, must be
explicitly sprinkled with finalizer invocations.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the very worst case, in a &#8220;normal&#8221; imperative language with concurrent
threads, these last two drawbacks could be addressed by the client-developer:
the client-developer can set their associated cleanup code to run on a
distinct thread (that the <em>mutator</em> manages, not the garbage collector).  This
avoids the ugly sprinkling/cross-cutting of concerns, and should ensure that
cleanup does eventually occur (assuming correctly-written multi-threaded code,
&#8220;ha ha&#8221;).</p>

<p>Of course, that last suggestion is essentially reimplementing the GC&#8217;s
finalizer thread as a mutator process.  But nonetheless, in principle this
could be implemented as a library, as long as the appropriate primitives are
available underneath.</p>

<p>By making explicit finalization expressible as a library,
the developer community would be free to propose competing API&#8217;s
and implementations.  That seems like a good thing for a young
experimental language.</p>

<p>(One <em>might</em> even be able to develop finalization
libraries that are &#8220;composable&#8221;, in the sense that different finalization
libraries could be used by distinct libraries in the same overall program.
One could coin the term
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposing_Composers">&#8220;composing decomposers&#8221;</a>
for such things.)</p>

<h2>Wait, what was that about &#8220;normal&#8221; languages?</h2>

<p>I wrote the end of the previous section intending for it to apply to Rust.
Then I realized that I do not have enough experience writing Rust programs to
be certain it is reasonable to develop a mutator-based cleanup process
that runs on its own thread.</p>

<p>I am only discussing cleanup for structures held in managed-boxes (not in
owned-boxes or stack-allocated).  It might be feasible to express cleanup
routines for managed boxes with relatively trivial types in Rust, at least for
some libraries.</p>

<p>But it might be that in practice, managed boxes would generally have
types that would make it impossible for a separate thread to extract them from
a guardian and be able to access their contents.</p>

<p>There is also the serious problem that such a cleanup thread seems likely to require
the use of mutex locks in order to coordinate with the &#8220;real&#8221; mutator; this in
particular seems antithetical to the ideals of Rust.</p>

<p>(Hopefully I will soon acquire sufficient experience with Rust itself to be
able to address this issue more coherently.)</p>

<!---

----

Another idiosyncrasy with a lot of the guardian-like systems is that they
enqueue the original object for processing, which is quite counter-intuitive
when one considers the effort that the GC went through to determine that the
object was otherwise unreachable.

This perhaps could be addressed by using something like the model described at
the start of section 3.1 of Boehm's paper, "Alternatives"; namely, instead of
enqueuing the unreachable object on a reference queue, the GC could instead
enqueue an associated distinct cleanup object. Boehm states that such a
cleanup object falls victim to all the same problems, but as I understand it,
that is only true if it is invoked by the GC in the same way that Java-style
finalizers are invoked, as described in his paper.

It would be interesting to know whether any managed runtimes offer only
guardians/reference-queues with this style of distinct associated cleanup
objects; I am not aware of any myself.  I might attempt to hack one up in the
future.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am not saying this is easy, and I am not saying that the systems I am
referencing get everything right either.  But implicit finalizers, even those invoked
from a system-managed asynchronous thread, are not the only answer.</p>

<p>Perhaps my pithy summary is that: Implicit finalizers are indeed inherently
asynchronous routines; but with explicit finalization, one has more options
(yet still may be able to fall back on asynchrony if necessary).</p>

<p>So, what does all of this mean for Rust?  Well, Niko already suggested
limiting destructors solely to types that contain only &#8220;owned data.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have no problem with that, since it clearly deals with all of the issues
that Boehm described.</p>

<p>But my suspicion is that Rust developers will soon discover that one really
does need the GC to feed information forward about the managed boxes that it
is collecting.  And so we will then be at a crossroads: Put in Java-style
finalizers, or adopt another approach?</p>

<p>My goal is to make sure we remember to consider those other approaches when we
hit that crossroads.</p>

<br/>Scheme Workshop 2010
<br/>(I only properly appreciated the value (and difficulties) of using guardians for such purposes after I read this paper)</li>
</ol>


<h2>Appendix A. What are Guardians?</h2>

<p>I here outline a concrete example of how this works in the case of Guardians
(adapted from <a href="http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/sw2010/02-hsu.pdf">Hsu</a>).  (To aid readability, I have replaced the use of
procedure-arity-based-dispatch, as written by Hsu to match the Chez Scheme
API, and I am rewriting his example with a new distinct named procedures .)</p>

<p>One can construct as many guardian instances (or simply &#8220;guardians&#8221;) as one wants.
Each guardian is associated with two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>reclaimable</code> : a set of objects previously determined to be reclaimable by the garbage collector, and</li>
<li><code>registry</code> : a set of objects scheduled to be eventually enqueued in the first set.</li>
</ol>


<p>Both of these sets are initially empty when the guardian is constructed.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; (define g (make-guardian))
&gt; (define v "VAL")
&gt; (define p (weak-cons v '())
&gt; (guardian-register! g v)

&gt; (set! v #f)                    ;; Now `"VAL"` is unreachable via strong-refs ...
&gt; (guardian-fetch! g)            ;; ... but GC has not discovered that yet.
#f

&gt; (collect-garbage)              ;; `"VAL"` is still unreachable ...
&gt; p                              ;; ... though one can access via weak paths ...
("VAL")
&gt; (define x (guardian-fetch! g)) ;; ... and the guardian held it in `reclaimable`
&gt; x
"VAL"

                                 ;; At this point, "VAL" is again strongly reachable
                                 ;; (via `x`).  However, it is *not* in either of the
                                 ;; sets for the guardian `g`, and thus is not scheduled
                                 ;; to be enqueued in the `reclaimable` set.

&gt; (set! x #f)                    ;; Now "VAL" is no longer strongly reachable...
&gt; (collect-garbage)
&gt; p                              ;; ... and thus can be reclaimed.
(#!blank-weak-pointer)
</code></pre>

<p>So, what does this have to do with finalization?</p>

<p>With the guardian API in hand, one could take care of closing individual
file descriptors associated with heap-allocated file objects, by
a protocol such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create one guardian G for the file library, whose sole purpose is closing
file descriptors.</p></li>
<li><p>In the constructor for file objects, register each constructed file object
with G.</p></li>
<li><p>In a periodic process, dequeue objects from G and close their associated
file descriptors.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Appendix B. Another peeve about guardians</h2>

<p>One idiosyncrasy about a lot of the guardian-like systems is that they enqueue
the original object for processing, which is quite counter-intuitive to me
given the effort that the GC went through to determine that the object was
otherwise unreachable.</p>

<p>Perhaps this could be addressed by using something like the model described at
the start of section 3.1 of Boehm&#8217;s paper, &#8220;Alternatives&#8221;; namely, instead of
enqueuing the unreachable object on a reference queue, the GC could instead
enqueue an associated distinct cleanup object, and reclaim the originally
registered object itself. (Boehm states that such a cleanup object falls
victim to all the same problems, but as I understand it, that is only true if
it is invoked by the GC in the same way that Java-style finalizers are
invoked, as described in his paper.)</p>

<p>The associated cleanup object would need to carry any state necessary for the
cleanup action (e.g., the file descriptor itself).  So that seems like a
potential for ugly redundancy and wastage (in either time or space, depending
on whether uses a level of indirection or simply redundantly stores all the
necessary state in the object and in its associated cleanup object.).</p>

<p>But nonetheless, a decoupled system like this may be easier to reason about,
especially when one has scenarios where an object is registered with multiple
guardians/reference-queues.</p>

<p>As far as I understand, the reference queue system in Java, as described by
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/finalization-137655.html">Printezis</a>, is sufficient to express a structure like this.  Still, it
would be interesting to know whether any managed runtimes offer <em>only</em>
guardians/reference-queues with this style of distinct associated cleanup
objects; I am not aware of any that are so conservative.  I might attempt to
hack one up in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>It&#8217;s Clobbering Time</h2>

<p>Remember that thing I said back <a href="http://github.com.github.com/pnkfelix/pnkfx-blog/blog/2012/12/31/hello-world">at the end of 2012</a>?
That thing?
That thing about the important detail that:</p>

<blockquote><p>the <code>_deploy/</code> subdirectory is itself a clone of the targeted
github repository, with the <code>gh-pages</code> branch checked out.</p></blockquote>

<p>It turns out this is really important detail.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s why: For my first blogging act of the new year, I inadvertently destroyed
my own blog.</p>

<p>I attempted to write a post from a computer other than the one out of
which I had already worked all the octopress-compatibility kinks.
In the hustle of dealing with <code>rbenv</code> and various other ruby-oriented
dependencies, I forgot about the detail above.</p>

<p>And then when I ran <code>rake deploy</code>, I clobbered the live blog.</p>

<p>I may have been recovering from, or incapacitated by, New Years
revelry at the time, it is not clear to me at the current moment.  I
believe I identified the disaster right after it happened, but immediately
decided I did not have the time then to diagnose it, fix it,
or even to attempt to rollback the
state and repush to github.  I vaguely remember considering that last option
and deciding that even that was out of the question.  (I think a pending
trip to a Karaoke bar may have been involved in the decision-making
process here.)</p>

<p>So, tonight I diagnosed and fixed the problem.</p>

<p>At first I was just going to let the matter lie undocumented, and
pretend like it never happened.</p>

<p>But I realized that I may well again make the same mistake in the future,
and that it behooved me to at least document the issue in my commit
log for <a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix/pnkfx-blog/commits/blog.pnkfx.org">the blog source</a>.</p>

<p>And after writing that commit log entry and pushing it, I decided that
this story was in fact blog worthy; after all, what is the point of
a blog if not to freely broadcast your mistakes?  :)</p>

<p>So, directly from <a href="https://github.com/pnkfelix/pnkfx-blog/commit/f277b041de33a8e0eac02c6aecb3909231725db7">my commit message</a>, here is the description of how
I clobbered my own blog:</p>

<blockquote><p>The easy way to sum it up is: The model
employed by octopress when deploying to github is this: Your <em>deploy/
subdirectory must contain a checkout of the target repo, the one with
the gh-pages branch, and you must have that </em>deploy/ subdirectory
checked out and ready to go before running &#8216;rake deploy&#8217;.</p>

<p>If you do not have a _deploy/ subdirectory at all and you let &#8216;rake
deploy&#8217; create it for you but you also let &#8216;rake deploy&#8217; attempt to
push to github, and you are also managing the source itself on github,
you will enter a world of pain where the rake invocation will push
<em>this</em> root directory, presumably in the master branch (or in my case,
blog.pnkfx.org branch) to the target repo in the gh-pages/ branch.
Which will bust things terribly, especially if that causes the CNAME
file to get deleted from the gh-pages/ branch of the target repo.</p></blockquote>

<h2>A note on self-reference</h2>

<p>Also, a quick half shout-out, or maybe corrective note, to
<a href="http://www.seamusbradley.net/blog/blog/2012/04/24/how-to-link-to-your-own-blog-posts-in-octopress/">seamusbradley</a> for pointing out some details about linking back to
one&#8217;s own blog posts.</p>

<p>It is only a half shout-out because Seamus&#8217;s note is only useful, I
think, if you have, like him, a customized setting for the <code>root:</code> in
your <code>_config.yml</code>.  That, or Seamus has confused himself and changed
his <code>root</code> setting in order to accommodate other url&#8217;s that he
observed, but those urls are in fact actually generated by settings
for properties other than <code>root</code>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the concrete details: I read (misread?) Seamus&#8217;s post at first
as saying that a customized setting of <code>root</code> to <code>/blog</code> is a
prerequisite for linking to your own posts.  It seems to me that the
relevant detail is what the <em>permalink</em> setting is, not the root.
(But then again, I have not played with changing my root setting,
apart from finding that when I did try changing it to <code>/blog</code> as
Seamus suggested, it seems like doing so broke <code>rake preview</code>.)</p>

<p>In my case, the <code>root</code> and <code>permalink</code> for my <code>_config.yml</code>
are set as follows:</p>

<pre><code>root: /
permalink: /blog/:year/:month/:day/:title/
</code></pre>

<p>and I format links to my own posts, such as the one you are reading,
like so:
<a href="http://github.com.github.com/pnkfelix/pnkfx-blog/blog/2013/01/08/resurrected-hello-again-world"><code>/blog/2013/01/08/resurrected-hello-again-world</code></a>
as you can see from looking at the source for the line above,</p>

<pre><code>[`/blog/2013/01/08/resurrected-hello-again-world`](/blog/2013/01/08/resurrected-hello-again-world)
</code></pre>

<p>A bit of quoted self-reference is a good place to stop for the night.</p>

open-source window-management tool for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>It is very cool, mainly in that it is very configurable (but with a
reasonably readable syntax for its configuration file).</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing to say is: Do not judge it solely
based upon its default configuration file, which is very bare bones
and does not illustrate anything near the full feature set that it

<p>Instead, I recommend one at least read over Tristan Hume&#8217;e <a href="http://thume.ca/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/" title="Tristan Hume: Using Slate">blog post</a>,
which advertises Slate much more effectively than the project&#8217;s
github page.  The blog post describes some of the crucial features that are not
exposed in the default configuration.  In particular, the
window-switcher shortcut, which overlays each window with a
letter to give that window focus, is much more tile-friendly
if you also turn on</p>

First 7 lines of this file were generated by command invocation:

<p>First post!
I am attempting to move my blog to GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>After seeing the results of others, I figure I will start with Octopress
and see how that goes.</p>

<p>Just so I can remind myself of the Octopress basics in the immediate future:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Much of the page generation is controlled by configuration file <code>_config.yml</code></p></li>
<li><p>The content is all stored in <code>source/_posts/</code></p></li>
<li><p>This particular entry corresponds to the file <code>2012-12-31-hello-world.markdown</code></p></li>
<li><p>The first 7 lines of that file were originally generated via the
<code>rake</code> command invocation:</p>

<pre><code>% rake new_post["Hello World"]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The command <code>rake generate</code> will convert the source into static html pages.</p></li>
<li><p>After generating the file (and during subsequent editting), one can preview
the state locally in a local Ruby webserver via:</p>

<pre><code>% rake preview
</code></pre>

<p>and then <a href="http://localhost:4000/">browsing localhost port 4000</a>.
The <code>rake preview</code> invocation will continuously monitor your post
source files so that you can keep working on your post and then
reload in your web browser without rerunning <code>rake</code> itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The command <code>rake deploy</code> is supposed to deploy the content into its intended
live location.  I have been having difficulty using this command,
in part because I think it is written assuming you have your ssh-key
already set up and integrated with github (or something similar) so that
there would be no password prompts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>But of course I have not done this yet.</p></li>
<li><p>One important detail about <code>rake deploy</code> with github pages is that
the <code>_deploy/</code> subdirectory is itself a clone of the targetted
github repository, with the <code>gh-pages</code> branch checked out.
This can be confusing if your main source tree (the parent
directory of <code>_deploy/</code>) is itself the same repository as the
targetted github repository.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Update: <code>rake deploy</code> just worked fine for me, password prompts and all.
I think my earlier difficulty was an artifact of some previous bad
state, one of either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had put in a malformatted url for the target repository</p></li>
<li><p>My target repository already had a <code>gh-pages</code> branch (from earlier
testing) that needed to be pulled-and-merged (or discarded in some
fashion, which was what my merge amounted to).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
