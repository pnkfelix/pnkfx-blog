First post!
I am attempting to move my blog to GitHub Pages.

After seeing the results of others, I figure I will start with Octopress
and see how that goes.

Just so I can remind myself of the Octopress basics in the immediate future:

* Much of the page generation is controlled by configuration file `_config.yml`

* The content is all stored in `source/_posts/`

* This particular entry corresponds to the file `2012-12-31-hello-world.markdown`

* The first 7 lines of that file were originally generated via the
  `rake` command invocation:

      % rake new_post["Hello World"]

* After generating the file (and during subsequent editting), one can preview
  the state locally in a local Ruby webserver via:

      % rake preview

  and then [browsing localhost port 4000](http://localhost:4000/).
  The `rake preview` invocation will continuously monitor your post
  source files so that you can keep working on your post and then
  reload in your web browser without rerunning `rake` itself.
